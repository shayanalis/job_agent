Add concrete impact: number of analysts, hours saved per analyst per week, and % reduction in lookup time (e.g., '...saving 2.5 hrs/week for 12 analysts; 70% reduction in lookup time').\\n- Leaficient – Bullet 5: Strong, but consider aligning to JD by explicitly stating 'real-time collaboration' (e.g., '...enabled real-time collaboration across field teams; reduced refresh churn by 40%').\\n- Educative (Software Engineer) – If applicable, mention rich text rendering or document/presentation authoring features to align with iWork (Pages/Numbers/Keynote) domain.\\n\\nMissing keywords to incorporate (only if accurate): C, Objective-C, C++, Swift, Apple, iWork, Pages, Numbers, Keynote. Consider also Apple-adjacent terms for stronger alignment if you have them: Xcode, AppKit/UIKit, Cocoa, XCTest/XCUITest, Core Text, Core Graphics, Metal, macOS, iOS.\\n\\nTAR (Task–Action–Result) rewrite suggestions:\\n- Leaficient – Bullet 5: 'Built multi-user live dashboards using React Hooks and WebSockets to enable real-time collaboration; reduced refresh churn by 40% across field teams.'\\n- DHS – Bullet 3: 'Prototyped a RAG assistant in Python with role-based access controls to automate SQL lookups; cut query time 70% and saved 2–3 hrs/week per analyst (n=12).'\\n- Educative – Add domain alignment if true: 'Implemented rich-text editing and content rendering in JavaScript; reduced initial render time 50% and improved lesson start CTR 3.1%.'\\n- Projects (add if you have them): 'Implemented a macOS text editor in Swift (AppKit, Core Text); added CRDT-based real-time collaboration; sustained <150ms local latency for 5 concurrent collaborators.'\\n\\nStructural/ATS improvements:\\n- Group Skills by category and put JD-critical languages first (C/C++/Swift/Objective-C, then JavaScript/Python). Avoid duplicates.\\n- Add GitHub/portfolio link next to LinkedIn to showcase C/C++/Swift/macOS/iOS code samples.\\n- Fix Education location punctuation (e.g., 'Carnegie Mellon University — Pittsburgh, PA'). Consider adding relevant systems/C/C++ courses (e.g., Systems Programming, Operating Systems, Computer Graphics) if taken.\\n\\nTargeted content additions:\\n- If you have any C/C++/Swift work (coursework, open source, hobby apps), add a Projects section with 2–3 bullets using TAR format and measurable results (performance, memory usage, FPS, startup time). Include Apple tooling (Xcode, XCTest), and UI frameworks (AppKit/UIKit) to boost relevance.\\n- Explicitly mention 'real-time collaboration' where you used WebSockets or multi-user features; this mirrors the JD.\\n\\nOnce you incorporate the missing JD keywords and add at least basic evidence of C/C++/Swift and Apple ecosystem experience, your keyword coverage should rise above 60% and the resume will likely pass the initial screen while retaining strong impact metrics.\\n\\nInstructions:\\n1. Study the job requirements and identify key technologies, skills, and metrics they value\\n2. Write TAR format bullets that directly address job requirements\\n3. Incorporate exact keywords from JD naturally within achievements\\n4. Ensure each bullet demonstrates impact, not just responsibilities\\n5.

Total ≈66/100. Critical failure: Keyword coverage 18% (<60%), so resume is invalid for this JD.\\n\\nMissing keywords to incorporate exactly: C, Objective-C, C++, Swift, Apple, iWork, Pages, Numbers, Keynote. Highly recommended platform/toolchain keywords: iOS, macOS, SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit, Xcode, Objective-C++.\\n\\nSpecific bullets needing stronger metrics or context:\\n- Department of Human Services – bullet 3 (RAG): Replace 'cut analyst effort by hours weekly' with a precise figure and scope. Example TAR: Built a RAG agent using Python + LangChain + PostgreSQL; automated record lookups and reduced analyst workload by 10–12 hours/week across 5 analysts while maintaining HIPAA-compliant access controls.\\n- Leaficient – CI/CD bullet: Add scope and cadence.

Total ≈66/100. Critical failure: Keyword coverage 18% (<60%), so resume is invalid for this JD.\\n\\nMissing keywords to incorporate exactly: C, Objective-C, C++, Swift, Apple, iWork, Pages, Numbers, Keynote. Highly recommended platform/toolchain keywords: iOS, macOS, SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit, Xcode, Objective-C++.\\n\\nSpecific bullets needing stronger metrics or context:\\n- Department of Human Services – bullet 3 (RAG): Replace 'cut analyst effort by hours weekly' with a precise figure and scope. Example TAR: Built a RAG agent using Python + LangChain + PostgreSQL; automated record lookups and reduced analyst workload by 10–12 hours/week across 5 analysts while maintaining HIPAA-compliant access controls.\\n- Leaficient – CI/CD bullet: Add scope and cadence. Example TAR: Implemented CI/CD with GitHub Actions and CloudWatch across 12 microservices; sustained 99.5% uptime, cut MTTR to <24h, and increased deployment frequency from weekly to daily (5x).\\n- Leaficient – Containerization bullet: Add scale or cost impact. Example TAR: Containerized GPU inference on AWS EKS (A10G, g5.xlarge) with horizontal pod autoscaling; reduced p95 inference latency 30% and cut compute cost 18% at 50K images/day.\\n- Leaficient – Model evaluation bullet: Add dataset size/cadence. Example TAR: Built MLflow-driven regression checks over a 120K-image holdout; reduced false positives 20% and blocked 3 faulty releases/quarter.\\n- Educative (TPM) – Core Web Vitals bullet: Specify metrics. Example TAR: Directed React code-splitting with Webpack/Route-based chunks; reduced LCP from 3.1s to 2.4s (p75) and improved INP 19% across 2.3M sessions.\\n\\nApple/iWork targeting recommendations:\\n- Add a Projects section (above Experience or after) with Apple-platform work that uses the required languages. Example bullets (TAR format):\\n  • Shipped an iOS document editor in Swift/SwiftUI with real-time collaboration via CRDT over CloudKit; achieved p95 join-to-edit time of 350 ms and 1.2K MAU; integrated text layout core written in C++17 via Objective-C++ bridging.\\n  • Implemented a macOS Numbers-like table engine in Objective-C++ with incremental recalculation and dependency graph; improved formula eval throughput 2.4x vs baseline on 100K-cell sheets.\\n  • Built a Keynote-style presenter mode prototype using Swift + Metal for slide transitions; reduced frame drops to <1% on M1 MacBook Air.\\n- Add a tailored summary at the top: Software Engineer with experience in real-time collaboration and performance optimization; seeking to contribute to Apple’s iWork suite (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) using Swift/Objective-C/C++.\\n- Update Skills to prioritize Apple stack: Swift, Objective-C, C++, C, SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit, Xcode, Instruments, Metal (if applicable), plus JavaScript as secondary. Keep AWS/ML but de-emphasize.\\n- Weave Apple keywords naturally into bullets or summary to satisfy ATS: Apple, iWork, Pages, Numbers, Keynote.\\n\\nTAR format guidance (use action + tech + result with metric):\\n- Instead of 'Responsible for X', write 'Built X using Y; achieved Z metric'.\\n- Example conversions:\\n  • Current: 'Prototyped Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using Python and SQL to automate record lookups; cut analyst effort by hours weekly...' \\n    Revised: 'Prototyped a RAG agent using Python, LangChain, and PostgreSQL; automated record lookups and reduced analyst workload by 10–12 hours/week while preserving row-level access controls.'\\n  • New Apple project: 'Developed a real-time co-authoring engine using CRDT in Swift with WebSockets; enabled conflict-free edits across 50 concurrent users with <200 ms update latency.'\\n\\nATS and formatting:\\n- Maintain single-column layout, standard headings (Summary, Skills, Projects, Experience, Education).\\n- Fix Education formatting: 'Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA'.\\n- Add GitHub/portfolio URL (https://github.com/...); keep LinkedIn as https://linkedin.com/in/ali-shayan.\\n\\nWhy it was marked invalid:\\n- Keyword coverage is 18% (2/11: JavaScript, Software Engineer). Required skills (C, Objective-C, C++, Swift) and Apple/iWork suite keywords are missing. Incorporate the above keywords with authentic evidence (Projects section) to reach ≥60% coverage and pass ATS.\\n\"}, \"generated_doc_path\": \"generated_resumes/Resume_Apple_Software_Engineer,_iWork_Team_20251007_231744.docx\", \"resume_url\": \"\", \"retry_count\": 4, \"error_message\": \"\", \"status\": \"generated\"}", "mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"tr-38639d6297be3eb94470b1beb981f652\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"CHAIN\""}, "status": {"message": "", "code": "STATUS_CODE_OK"}}, {"trace_id": "OGOdYpe+PrlEcLG+uYH2Ug==", "span_id": "k3ZQ8GcVrHc=", "trace_state": "", "parent_span_id": "/UW62b1zCK8=", "name": "ChatOpenAI_11", "start_time_unix_nano": 1759893464135859000, "end_time_unix_nano": 1759893569262641000, "attributes": {"mlflow.chat.tokenUsage": "{\"input_tokens\": 2090, \"output_tokens\": 4865, \"total_tokens\": 6955}", "invocation_params": "{\"model\": \"gpt-5\", \"model_name\": \"gpt-5\", \"stream\": false, \"n\": 1, \"temperature\": 1.0, \"_type\": \"openai-chat\", \"stop\": null}", "metadata": "{\"langgraph_step\": 21, \"langgraph_node\": \"validate_complete\", \"langgraph_triggers\": [\"generate_doc\"], \"langgraph_path\": [\"__pregel_pull\", \"validate_complete\"], \"langgraph_checkpoint_ns\": \"validate_complete:b0193b4a-1b46-ca92-fb29-d7c02720eea6\", \"checkpoint_ns\": \"validate_complete:b0193b4a-1b46-ca92-fb29-d7c02720eea6\", \"ls_provider\": \"openai\", \"ls_model_name\": \"gpt-5\", \"ls_model_type\": \"chat\", \"ls_temperature\": 1.0}", "mlflow.message.format": "\"langchain\"", "mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"tr-38639d6297be3eb94470b1beb981f652\"", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "{\"generations\": [[{\"text\": \"{\\n    \\\"is_valid\\\": false,\\n    \\\"keyword_coverage_score\\\": 18,\\n    \\\"issues_found\\\": [\\n        \\\"Keyword coverage 18% (<60%) for this Apple iWork JD; most required keywords are missing (C, Objective-C, C++, Swift, Apple, iWork, Pages, Numbers, Keynote)\\\",\\n        \\\"Skills section does not include required languages (C, Objective-C, C++, Swift) or Apple/iOS/macOS frameworks\\\",\\n        \\\"Experience bullets do not reference Apple ecosystem development (UIKit/AppKit/SwiftUI), desktop/mobile app features, or real-time collaboration relevant to iWork\\\",\\n        \\\"Missing GitHub/portfolio link to demonstrate C/Swift/C++ work\\\",\\n        \\\"Minor tense inconsistency: current role (Present) uses past-tense verbs\\\",\\n        \\\"Skills are not grouped/prioritized for the target role\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"suggestions\\\": [\\n        \\\"Add missing keywords explicitly: C, Objective-C, C++, Swift, Apple, iWork, Pages, Numbers, Keynote; ensure they appear in Skills and in at least a few Experience/Projects bullets where accurate\\\",\\n        \\\"Introduce an Apple/iOS/macOS Projects section showcasing Swift/Objective-C apps (e.g., document editor, spreadsheet engine, presentation tooling, real-time collaboration) and link to GitHub/TestFlight/App Store\\\",\\n        \\\"Expand Skills to prioritize Apple stack: Swift, Objective-C, C++, C, JavaScript; Frameworks: SwiftUI, UIKit/AppKit, CoreGraphics, CoreText/TextKit 2, Core Data, CloudKit, WebKit; Tooling: Xcode, Instruments (Time Profiler, Allocations), XCTest/XCUITest; Concurrency: GCD, NSOperation, async/await; Networking: URLSession, WebSockets; Performance: SIMD/Metal (if true)\\\",\\n        \\\"Map existing achievements to iWork-relevant themes (rich text/layout, rendering, performance, collaboration): add bullets that mention TextKit, layout engines, rendering optimizations, CRDTs/OT, WebSockets, file formats (RTF/Docx/CSV), and accessibility/localization\\\",\\n        \\\"If you have C++/C experience (e.g., PyTorch C++ extensions or image kernels), surface it: add bullets like 'Wrote C++ image ops and bridged to Swift via Objective-C++ for GPU-accelerated pipelines'\\\",\\n        \\\"Adjust tense: use present tense for current role; past tense for prior roles\\\",\\n        \\\"Add a GitHub/portfolio link in the header; keep ATS-friendly one-column format\\\",\\n        \\\"Use TAR format consistently: Action + Tech + Result with a clear metric; add exact numbers where ranges are used (e.g., 'months to days' -> '12 weeks to 3 days')\\\",\\n        \\\"Reorder or add a 'Relevant Experience' section to bring any app/UI/performance work to the top for better JD alignment\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"feedback_for_rewrite\\\": \\\"Score breakdown (approx.): Relevance to JD 8/35, Impact & Metrics 17/20, Clarity & Structure 13/15, ATS Compliance 14/15, Skills Section 3/10, Contact/Links 3/5.
