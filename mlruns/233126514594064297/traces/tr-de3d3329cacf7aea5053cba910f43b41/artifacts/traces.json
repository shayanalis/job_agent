Optional tooling keywords if accurate: 'Spark', 'Hadoop', 'Airflow', 'dbt', 'EMR', 'Glue', 'Databricks'.\\n\\nTAR (Task–Action–Result) rewrites to mirror JD and add metrics:\\n- DHS, agent bullet: 'Built a retrieval-augmented agent using Python + LLMs to automate governed SQL lookups with RBAC and audit logging; reduced analyst effort by 12 hrs/week and cut query turnaround by 60% while maintaining privacy controls.'\\n- Educative TPM, policy bullet: 'Defined data retention/access standards and implemented policy-as-code in BigQuery/GCP IAM; achieved GDPR compliance and passed 2 external audits with 0 critical findings.'\\n- Educative TPM, cross-functional bullet: 'Led privacy-by-design reviews across 12 services with Eng/Legal/Product; reduced approval cycle from 3 weeks to 10 days and established processes later adapted for HIPAA workflows.'\\n- Leaficient, validation bullet (add cost control): 'Implemented automated data validation and anomaly detection in MLflow with entropy/outlier checks; blocked 35% bad ingress and reduced re-training compute by 20%.'\\n- Educative SWE, backend bullet (add p99): 'Engineered Python REST APIs with idempotent retries and circuit breakers; scaled to 2M+ MAU at p99 latency <250 ms and 99.9% uptime.'\\n\\nATS/structure and polish:\\n- Fix spacing/punctuation in education/locations (e.g., 'Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA'; 'Department of Human Services, Pittsburgh, PA').\\n- Maintain consistent tense (present role in present tense, past roles in past tense).\\n- Group Skills: Programming (Python, SQL), Data Eng (ETL/ELT, Airflow, dbt, Spark), Cloud (AWS: Lambda, S3, EC2, EKS; GCP: BigQuery), ML/Analytics (scikit-learn, MLflow, anomaly detection), Data Governance/Healthcare (Data quality/validation, PHI, HIPAA, de-identification, OMOP CDM, FHIR, EHR/HL7). Remove minor redundancy by listing 'AWS' once with services.\\n\\nHealthcare alignment (add where accurate):\\n- Add a bullet under DHS or Leaficient highlighting 'patient-level/PHI' handling and de-identification (e.g., 'Prepared de-identified patient-level cohorts using k-anonymity and masking; documented data lineage and IRB alignment').\\n- If familiar, add 'Mapped clinical observations to OMOP CDM tables and FHIR resources (Patient, Observation, Encounter) for downstream analytics' (only if true).\\n\\nRole/title alignment:\\n- In header or current role, add a synonym for ATS: 'Machine Learning Engineer (ML Data Engineer)'. Include 'Big Data systems design' and 'troubleshooting' in a bullet to match JD phrasing.\\n\\nIf these changes are made, expected keyword coverage can rise to ~85–90%, and overall score to ~90+/100.\"}, \"generated_doc_path\": \"generated_resumes/Resume_Stanford_University_School_of_Medicine_ML_Data_Engineer_–_Healthcare_Data_Curation_&_Cleaning_(1_Year_Fixed_Term)_20251108_205913.docx\", \"resume_url\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fo4D8f0yMqAgcXk4Q_I3qzHpwnTPIEqS/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=105335645731389627469&rtpof=true&sd=true\", \"retry_count\": 0, \"error_message\": \"\", \"status\": \"completed\"}", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"job_description\": \"Life at Stanford\\nAreas of Work\\nLocations\\nStories\\nMy SubmissionsJob SearchMy Profile\\nINFORMATION ANALYTICS\\nML Data Engineer – Healthcare Data Curation & Cleaning (1 Year Fixed Term)\\nSchool of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States\\nApply for Job\\nThank you for your interest in Stanford University.
