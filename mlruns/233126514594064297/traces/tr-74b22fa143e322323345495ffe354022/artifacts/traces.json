As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer, you’ll help define how next-generation intelligent agents reason, plan, and interact with people through natural voice and multimodal experiences. You will develop the foundations of scalable LLM reasoning systems that will power the next wave of human–AI interaction.\\nDescription\\nWe’re seeking a senior ML engineer with strong expertise in large language models and agent-based systems to build the core reasoning and simulation capabilities behind a future platform for agentic voice experiences. You will work on advancing how LLMs plan, adapt, and evaluate actions in realistic environments, contributing to the development of reliable and trustworthy AI agents. Your work will focus on developing robust infrastructure and tooling for training, simulation, and evaluation of agentic LLMs. You’ll design and run experiments in simulated environments, build scalable evaluation pipelines, and help integrate agent behaviors across client and backend systems.
