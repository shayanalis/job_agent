Architected and shipped real-time intelligence systems, collaborating directly with founders and users to deliver impact fast.'\\n- In 1–2 Leaficient bullets, add 'AI-powered' and 'real-time intelligence'; in Educative bullets, emphasize shipping velocity and ownership (e.g., 'owned core systems from design to production').\\n\\nIf you implement the above, projected keyword coverage will exceed 80% and overall score should rise into the mid/high 80s.\\n\\nTransform each pointer into polished TAR format bullets that directly address the job requirements.
