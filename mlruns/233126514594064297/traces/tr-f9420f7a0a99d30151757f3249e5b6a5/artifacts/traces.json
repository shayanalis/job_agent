We support that goal by continuously and automatically assessing the health and performance of the world’s +$1T specialty crops, one plant at a time, with deep learning and imaging. Currently, Bloomfield is focused on wine, table, and juice grapes as well as, more recently, blueberries. Our portable Flash cameras and supporting platform capture, geo-locate and share the condition of each vine, tree and bush, along with the various features of that plant. This information, in turn, informs a variety of decisions and actions that growers take every day to increase the size, quality and consistency of yields and doing so without increasing the resources used to produce those yields. \\n \\n\\nAbout the Role\\n\\nOur rapidly growing engineering team is in search of an AI Engineer to lead the design and development of deep learning models on large amounts of high resolution image data, as well as analytical modeling solutions at scale on a cloud platform. \\n\\nAs an AI Engineer, you will work at start-up speed and can plan and develop roadmaps, adapting along the way to dynamic conditions. You should have a detail-oriented engineering and algorithmic mindset, and enjoy building, instrumenting, testing, and documenting large systems. You will have broad responsibilities, build a team as we grow, and be a part of the senior team.  This is a full-time, exempt position that reports to the Head of Product.\\n\\nResponsibilities \\n\\nDeep model development: develop new image processing models that include feature detection and instance segmentation. \\nDevelop and track model performance metrics across a variety of applications and data sets. \\nIntegrate model development and deployment into cloud-based automated data processing pipeline. \\nDevelop processes and algorithms for effective model retraining as necessary. You should have.\\nData labeling: develop image labeling strategies for new model training and validation, including processes for on-going Q&A of deployed models. Evaluate labeling tools, including compatibility with AI training and validation systems. \\nTrain and deploy models using Pytorch, MLFlow, Sagemaker in AWS.\\nRequirements\\n\\n3+ years of experience developing cloud-based AI solutions\\nProficient in common deep learning tools, including PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, and TensorFlow\\nExperience with multi-class models and hierarchical classification\\nProficient in common programming languages, including Python, C++, Java\\nBonus Points\\n\\nMS degree in computer science, mathematics, engineering, or similar field\\nProficient in Machine Learning Operations management, with extensive AWS experience, and demonstrated experience with complete model lifecycle management\\nPrevious projects implementing Mask-RCNN and/or AWS Sagemaker\\nExperience with stereo and multi-view image data \\n\\nWhat We Offer\\nIn addition to the opportunity to apply and develop your skills toward key business objectives, we offer an excellent compensation package including:\\n\\nCompetitive base salary and bonus\\nMedical, Dental and Vision Insurance\\n401(k) retirement plan\\nUnlimited PTO policy\\nParental Leave \\nTraining & Development Stipend\\nBloomfield is an equal opportunity employer.
