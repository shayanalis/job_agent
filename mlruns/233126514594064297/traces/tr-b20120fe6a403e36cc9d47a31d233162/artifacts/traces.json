AREAS TO IMPROVE FOR THIS JD: 1) Keyword alignment to Fluency (Vue.js, Bootstrap, 'Frontend Engineer' phrasing), 2) Minor formatting/polish, 3) A few bullets could use sharper metrics. MISSING/UNDERUSED KEYWORDS TO INCORPORATE: • Vue.js • Bootstrap • Angular (even 'familiarity' if true) • Senior Front End Engineer • Frontend Engineer • RESTful (exact term) • AWS Elastic Beanstalk (only if you’ve used it; otherwise omit) SPECIFIC BULLETS THAT NEED METRICS OR CLARITY: • Educative — Software Engineer — Bullet 1: 'increasing weekly active users from thousands to tens of thousands' → quantify (e.g., 'from 5K to 45K WAU in 6 months'). • Educative — Software Engineer — Bullet 4: 'boosting content discovery' → add a metric (e.g., '+18% searches-to-clicks conversion' or '+25% CTR to relevant content'). • Educative — Technical Product Manager — Bullet 4: 'on-time delivery under GDPR' → add % on-time and number of releases or modules (e.g., 'delivered 4/4 releases on time'). • Department of Human Services — Bullet 3: 'decreased turnaround from days to hours' → specify typical reduction (e.g., 'from ~3 days to <2 hours; 20+ pulls/mo'). • Leaficient — Bullet 5: add volume or rate (e.g., 'resolved 15–20 client issues/week within 24‑hour SLA'). ATS/FORMATTING FIXES: • Add commas/spaces in Education and Experience headers: 'Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA'; 'Department of Human Services, Pittsburgh, PA'. • Keep section headings standard (Education, Experience, Skills) as you have. • Add a brief headline: 'Senior Frontend Engineer | React, JavaScript, AWS' to boost keyword match. SKILLS SECTION (GROUP & PRIORITIZE): • Frontend: JavaScript, React, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap (if applicable), RESTful APIs. • Testing/Tooling: Jest/React Testing Library (if used), CI/CD, Docker. • Cloud: AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2; add Elastic Beanstalk only if real experience). • Backend: Python, Django, SQL. Put JD-relevant frontend skills first. TAR FORMAT IMPROVEMENTS (Tech + Action + Result): • Leaficient bullet 1: 'Built production dashboards from UX wireframes using React, Next.js, HTML5/CSS3; improved task completion by ~25% and doubled usability ratings in pilot tests.' • Educative (SE) bullet 1: 'Rebuilt onboarding flows in React/JS from product specs; grew WAU from 5K to 45K in 6 months.' • Educative (TPM) bullet 2: 'Directed React performance work (code‑splitting, bundle optimization); cut LCP by 300ms and stabilized Core Web Vitals across top‑traffic pages.' • DHS bullet 3: 'Prototyped an audited agent for automated SQL lookups (Python/SQL); reduced data pull time from ~3 days to <2 hours across 20+ monthly requests while maintaining privacy constraints.' SENIORITY/POSITIONING: • Consider a 2–3 line Professional Summary emphasizing senior frontend leadership: 'Senior Frontend Engineer with 6+ years building React-based UIs on AWS; strong in RESTful integrations, testing, performance, and UX collaboration. Adept at translating mockups into scalable components and resolving client issues within SLAs.' • Sprinkle 'Frontend Engineer' phrasing into bullets or headline for keyword matching (avoid title misrepresentation in job history). LINKS: • Add GitHub/portfolio with 1–2 featured repos (React UI, performance, testing). • Ensure LinkedIn is fully spelled with https:// for ATS parsing. AFTER CHANGES, EXPECTED COVERAGE: Adding Vue.js/Bootstrap/Frontend Engineer terms and 'RESTful' wording should lift keyword coverage from ~69% to 85%+.

AREAS TO IMPROVE FOR THIS JD: 1) Keyword alignment to Fluency (Vue.js, Bootstrap, 'Frontend Engineer' phrasing), 2) Minor formatting/polish, 3) A few bullets could use sharper metrics. MISSING/UNDERUSED KEYWORDS TO INCORPORATE: • Vue.js • Bootstrap • Angular (even 'familiarity' if true) • Senior Front End Engineer • Frontend Engineer • RESTful (exact term) • AWS Elastic Beanstalk (only if you’ve used it; otherwise omit) SPECIFIC BULLETS THAT NEED METRICS OR CLARITY: • Educative — Software Engineer — Bullet 1: 'increasing weekly active users from thousands to tens of thousands' → quantify (e.g., 'from 5K to 45K WAU in 6 months'). • Educative — Software Engineer — Bullet 4: 'boosting content discovery' → add a metric (e.g., '+18% searches-to-clicks conversion' or '+25% CTR to relevant content'). • Educative — Technical Product Manager — Bullet 4: 'on-time delivery under GDPR' → add % on-time and number of releases or modules (e.g., 'delivered 4/4 releases on time'). • Department of Human Services — Bullet 3: 'decreased turnaround from days to hours' → specify typical reduction (e.g., 'from ~3 days to <2 hours; 20+ pulls/mo'). • Leaficient — Bullet 5: add volume or rate (e.g., 'resolved 15–20 client issues/week within 24‑hour SLA'). ATS/FORMATTING FIXES: • Add commas/spaces in Education and Experience headers: 'Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA'; 'Department of Human Services, Pittsburgh, PA'. • Keep section headings standard (Education, Experience, Skills) as you have. • Add a brief headline: 'Senior Frontend Engineer | React, JavaScript, AWS' to boost keyword match. SKILLS SECTION (GROUP & PRIORITIZE): • Frontend: JavaScript, React, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap (if applicable), RESTful APIs. • Testing/Tooling: Jest/React Testing Library (if used), CI/CD, Docker. • Cloud: AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2; add Elastic Beanstalk only if real experience). • Backend: Python, Django, SQL. Put JD-relevant frontend skills first. TAR FORMAT IMPROVEMENTS (Tech + Action + Result): • Leaficient bullet 1: 'Built production dashboards from UX wireframes using React, Next.js, HTML5/CSS3; improved task completion by ~25% and doubled usability ratings in pilot tests.' • Educative (SE) bullet 1: 'Rebuilt onboarding flows in React/JS from product specs; grew WAU from 5K to 45K in 6 months.' • Educative (TPM) bullet 2: 'Directed React performance work (code‑splitting, bundle optimization); cut LCP by 300ms and stabilized Core Web Vitals across top‑traffic pages.' • DHS bullet 3: 'Prototyped an audited agent for automated SQL lookups (Python/SQL); reduced data pull time from ~3 days to <2 hours across 20+ monthly requests while maintaining privacy constraints.' SENIORITY/POSITIONING: • Consider a 2–3 line Professional Summary emphasizing senior frontend leadership: 'Senior Frontend Engineer with 6+ years building React-based UIs on AWS; strong in RESTful integrations, testing, performance, and UX collaboration. Adept at translating mockups into scalable components and resolving client issues within SLAs.' • Sprinkle 'Frontend Engineer' phrasing into bullets or headline for keyword matching (avoid title misrepresentation in job history). LINKS: • Add GitHub/portfolio with 1–2 featured repos (React UI, performance, testing). • Ensure LinkedIn is fully spelled with https:// for ATS parsing. AFTER CHANGES, EXPECTED COVERAGE: Adding Vue.js/Bootstrap/Frontend Engineer terms and 'RESTful' wording should lift keyword coverage from ~69% to 85%+.

These passions not only set us apart in the industry, but also fuel our collective drive to reshape the industry and reinvent ourselves along the way. We're not just revolutionizing the digital advertising horizon, we're shaping an organization where every member feels a sense of pride and is inspired to do their best work.\\n\\nThe Fluency platform is built using a native AWS architecture.  We use JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS3, Java, Spring Boot, Aurora, S3, Elastic Beanstalk along with whatever else makes sense for the job at hand.\\n\\nJob Summary:  \\n\\nA Senior Frontend Engineer at Fluency will build key product features continuously improving the experience for our customers. You will do this by working with the Product and UX teams on current projects, interpreting product ideas and mockups to create new web-based user interfaces. You’ll balance a consistent look and feel across the application with these fresh features. You will collaborate often with other Software Engineers to define and refine our REST API and you naturally jump in to solve client issues with one of the existing product modules.\\n\\nYour Role:\\n\\nProject planning and execution based on the product development pipeline\\nCollaboration acr...\\nTarget Position: Senior Front End Engineer at FluencyRole Level: Senior\\nKey Requirements:- Required Skills: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Component-based JavaScript framework (e.g., Vue.js, React, Angular), Building web-based user interfaces from product specs/mockups, Consuming/integrating RESTful APIs, Writing well-designed, testable, efficient code, Standard HTML/CSS/JS best practices, Gathering and refining technical requirements, Software documentation- Keywords: Senior Front End Engineer, Frontend Engineer, JavaScript, Vue.js, React, Angular, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, REST API\\n\\nThink step-by-step:\\n1.
